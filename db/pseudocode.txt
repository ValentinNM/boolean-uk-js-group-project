    !! -> PSEUDOcode

Step 2
    1. build the HTML layout 
      1.1 need <main> for our main container section
      which is going to display the base layout
        -> header for the logo and name
        -> add a <form> with submit button for searching
        for the expenses by name
        -> add a <section> for the <ul> elements that
        are going to contain each individual
        expense displayed within a <li> 
            * need a total <div> to give us the 
            total of the expense item Price
        -> need a item counter(<div> what is going to
        display the current quant of items in the <ul>)
        -> form for adding a new expense item, going by:
            * name of the expense item
            * category of the expense item
            * price of the expense item
        -> submit <button> to add to the database

    1.2 need a <aside> for our filters section
    which is gonna allow the user to filter accordingly
        -> 1st filter type:
            * (method: select) by category = from the dropdown user can
                chose from the available cathegories in the database  
        -> 2st filter type:
            * (method: to be looked for) price range  = user can optionally
                insert their price range and get the results accordingy
        -> 2st^ filter type alternative -> if 2nd too hard we can then get the
                user predefined price ranges or less/ more than a certain set
                amount(ex: > £50  or < £200)
        ->3rd filter type:    
            * alphabetically = to be ordered by expense item name
    
    2. style with the CSS
    ->

    3.2 - building the functions to render the user imput of new
        expense item onto the list of expenses
